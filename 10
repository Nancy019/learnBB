# word embedding
project a word in a high dimensional space, and the projection is injective and structure saved

#game theory
watch a video from Yale. The professor play a game in his class and he is really interesting. I think I need more time to watch
the video and understand more about game theory.

Why I try to learn game theory is that now I have 2 choices, and I don't know if I can finish the hard one. The hard one need 
some knowledge about game theory, and dynamic optimization. So I want to learn something and see if I can work on it. 

The next 6 months will be very hard.
