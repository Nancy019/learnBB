#A student’s guide to undergraduate research

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00871-x

Always think about the big picture. Your undergraduate research doesn’t define what you’re going to do after your degree.
Keep reading and taking classes outside your comfort zone. Explore and learn as much as possible. Working out what you 
love is the best preparation you can get for the rest of your career.
