#Self-Delimiting Neural Networks[1]

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0118.pdf

I just read the abstract and the conclusion

I first noticed SLNN in a paper[2] which describe a model about forces that drive the customer to buy products and how the items 
interact with each other. In this model, they define a checkout item, and when the customer select the item then the shopping 
end. They mentioned in their paper that the checkout item is related with the 'halt neoron' in SLNN, which is used to signal 
the end of a sequence.
