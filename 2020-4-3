##maximum likelihood

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XepXtl9YKwc

data shows below, and p-theta chart shows above, I think is an interesting way to show the idea of maximum likelihood. We want to 
find a proper theta, which under theta we can get the observed value with the maximum probability.

We want to get the parameter theta just to fit the distribution, and use it easily.
