prior : based on our past experience, and we don't see the data

posterior : based on the data, we get the parameter, and we consider the new data

arXiv:1711.03560 [stat.ML]
Yesterday I found an formula in the paper above, page 10 Eq10, and unfortunately I don't know how to deduce the result from left
to right. After a friend tell me how to deduce, I seriously thought about it and I thought their are two main reasons why I don't know
how to solve the problem.

The first one is, I really don't undersatnd what conditional probability is. Every time I encounter a similiar problem, I didn't 
think about it by myself and I thought using the equation is just fine. I really need to think more about it. I just using my hands 
without my brain.

The other one is, I thought the derivation would be very complicated, and I was afraid that I can't get the answer. I thought my problem 
was not enough knowledge, but I was wrong.

So I hope in the future, I can think more when I learn something new, and I can have a try when I have no idea. Maybe I always make 
things more complicated.
