#how to build a game theory model

1. don't wait to have a perfect model before trying to present it. communicate
2. figure out some basic concepts

3. don't look at the literature too soon, so that you can build your own model, even though you don't get to publish it yourself.
but in this process you can learn something useful and you can have your own idea. And when you have your own model you can refer 
to the literature can communicate with those researchers.
4. formulate the problem in terms of simple example（write down the simplest model you can ever think of, see if something
interesting will happen.）用尽量简单的例子去揭示正在发生的事情的本质, then generalize it。简化获得结果，复杂化获得通用性
5. 不断的犯错，从复杂的模型中去掉一些东西，留下反映事物运行规律的本质的简单的东西。你可能做出一些别人已经做过的东西……
6. seminar：the more you talk about your work, the better the final paper will be. 研讨会要说重点。尽量一句废话都不要说。ppt简洁，大字
体。被问问题：会就回答，不会就说：‘好问题，结尾再讨论’。研讨会中要注意记笔记，记下别人的建议，否则你会忘记。
7. outline。 写论文时一边写一遍refer back outline
8. every talk should have a summary.
