#how to build a game theory model

1. don't wait to have a perfect model before trying to present it. communicate
2. figure out some basic concepts
3. formulate the problem in terms of simple example, then generalize it
4. don't look at the literature too soon, so that you can build your own model, even though you don't get to publish it yourself.
but in this process you can learn something useful and you can have your own idea. And when you have your own model you can refer 
to the literature can communicate with those researchers.
